abstract: We developed an efficient alternating updating algorithm for generalized tensor-response regression given covariates on multiple modes. The package contains three functions: tensorregress to implement tensor regression model. The inputs are response tensor, multiple covariate matrices, and a desired Tucker rank. The outputs is a constrained MLE for the coefficient tensor ; selerank to estimate the tucker rank of coefficient tensor based on BIC criterion; simdata to generate response tensor and multiple covariate under different settings.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

Linear model has a broad application in diverse fields of scientific research and technological development and thus high dimensional variable selection plays a pivotal role in contemporary statistical learning and scientific discovers. Starting from traditional methods such as Subset selection method, AIC, etc., this paper mainly introduces several popular selection methods under high dimensional scenario including LASSO, SCAD, Adaptive LASSO, MCP, Elastic net, Dantzig Selector and etc. Most of these methods are in the structure of penalized likelihood method while Dantzig Selector regularizes the estimate rather than the loss. In this paper, the analysis focuses on three properties of penalty functions: sparsity, approximately unbiased and continuity. The commonalities and distinguishing features of these methods are presented and emphasized. Simulation studies under varied scenario are also implemented to compare different methods.

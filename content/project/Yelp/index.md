People always enjoy local flavors with various tastes. Here are some chances to run a successful business. We intend to conclude some useful suggestions through the customer reviews from Yelp dataset. First, to give overall suggestions for all the local flavor restaurant in one state, we do screening to select the most important business features. Second, to give specific suggestions for individual business owner, we compare the word distrbutions of the review between particular business and the other business. Finally, we build a shiny app to implement our project practically.
